to ensure that written code is correct according to *Codacy* repoting.

Finally you need to set up badges into your repository *README* file. Badges can be obtained through project configuration pages on each platform (*CircleCI*, *Codecov*, *Codacy*).

Here is an example of repository README frontpage with such badges :
